Hey there! 🌟 From teaching 🎓 middle schoolers Python (yes, you read that right!) to diving headfirst into crafting automated solutions, my coding journey is a rollercoaster of excitement!

Ever heard of turning workplace tasks into a breeze? 🌪️ Well, that's my specialty! I'm all about creating automations that zap away repetitive tasks, leaving more room for creativity and impact. 🤖

Picture this: I single-handedly orchestrated a rockstar workflow at my last gig, transforming the lives of around 20 colleagues. 🎸 We're talking supercharged distribution of sales data to over 2000 healthcare plan sales champs. 🚀 With some coding magic, we fine-tuned sales conversion and client retention, making bonus calculations a piece of cake. 🍰

Right now, I'm jazzed up about bringing the Workday revolution to the University of Wisconsin! 💥 And hold onto your hats, because I'm venturing into the realms of AI and ChatGPT. 🤖🔮 Brace yourselves for more dynamite automations and turbocharged efficiency boosts!

Join me in this electrifying journey as I code, automate, and conquer! 🎮🚀
